**Predicting glucose episodes 30 minutes before they happen using deep learning, CGM data, and optional wearable sensors.**

## 🎯 What is GlucoGuard?

GlucoGuard is an AI-powered early warning system that analyzes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict dangerous blood sugar episodes before they occur. Using a sophisticated transformer-based model trained on 1,200+ patients, it provides:

- 🚨 **30-minute advance warnings** for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
- 📈 **Trend predictions** with CGM-compatible arrows (🔼🔼🔼 ➡️ 🔽🔽🔽)
- 💡 **Personalized recommendations** for meals, exercise, and insulin timing
- 📊 **Clinical metrics** including Time-in-Range, MAGE, and glycemic variability
- ⌚ **Wearable integration** (optional) for enhanced predictions using heart rate, activity, and sleep data

## 🌟 For Patients and Families

**Think of GlucoGuard as a smart weather forecast for your glucose levels.**

Instead of just telling you what your glucose is *right now*, it learns your unique patterns and predicts what will happen next. Just like a weather app tells you it will rain in 30 minutes so you can grab an umbrella, GlucoGuard tells you your glucose will go low so you can have a snack.

### How It Helps:
- **Early Warnings**: Get alerts 30 minutes before dangerous highs or lows
- **Peace of Mind**: Sleep better knowing the system is watching over you
- **Better Control**: Learn how food, exercise, and sleep affect your glucose
- **Smart Integration**: Works with your Apple Watch, Fitbit, or other wearables for even better predictions

*"Sarah's GlucoGuard detected her glucose falling rapidly after dinner. It warned her 25 minutes before a dangerous low, giving her time to have a snack and avoid the episode."*

## 🔬 For Healthcare Practitioners
